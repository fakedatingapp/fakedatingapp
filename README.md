# fakedatingapp

We focus on a new and yet uncovered way for malicious apps to make a profit. Users are lured into installing a particular kind of dating apps and paying subscription fees for the right to chatting with existing users. However, the sole purpose of these apps is to cheat new users into paying, as the existing accounts in these apps are usually fake identities managed by chatbots. This kind of apps is therefore referenced as "fraudulent dating apps".

We have detected 967 distinct FD apps and classified them into 22 families based on their code similarity.
